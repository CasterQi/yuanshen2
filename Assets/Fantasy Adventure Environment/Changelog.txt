- Ambient Occlusion to tree trunks
- ShaderGUI for FAE/Tree Trunk shader

Changed:
Trees:
- Wind response, Ambient Occlusion and Light Transmission for all trees has been improved and fine-tuned per tree type
- Corrected normals on Pine_A LOD meshes
- Corrected UVs of Spruce and Pine tree trunks so the material is less vertically stretched
- Lowered all trees 0.3 units, so the trunk doesn't appear to float on steep terrain surfaces

Wind:
- Wind strength is now a shader function and thus can be changed during runtime
- Wind weight parameter in shaders is renamed to "MaxWindStrength"

Grass:
- Light transmission now visible in shorter grass as well
- Improved grass wind color influence (only brightens, rather than darkening and brightening)

Changed:
- Tree trunk gradient is now inverted, making the top darker instead of the bottom (ambient occlusion for trunks to be added)
- Made wind vectors less uniform (Wind response for trees will soon be improved)
- Pigment map generator now works with mesh terrains with centered pivots
- Minor UI improvements
- Reduced splatmap size in demo scene

Fixed:
- High trunk weight wind values elongating the trees

1.0.9
Added
- Palm_B and Palm_C tree assets (with LODs, billboards)
- Dead branches to palm trees with separate color controls
- Custom inspector for WindController script
- Option to visualize the wind vectors in the Foliage, Grass and Tree Branch shader GUI's
